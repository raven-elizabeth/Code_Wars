# Code_Wars
___
This repository is primarily for my Python Code Wars solutions. 
I will occasionally add my solutions to challenges from other platforms as well.

This provides me with an overview of my developing coding skills and allows me to review my code effectively.
I enjoy seeing how other people have solved the same problems and have added some of these under a `# Alternatives:` comment within the files.

This means I am able to take full advantage of the Code Wars platform, enhancing my learning by investigating others' solutions and methods.
