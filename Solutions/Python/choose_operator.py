# Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.
# The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
# The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

# My solution:
def basic_op(operator, value1, value2):
    if operator == "+":
        return value1 + value2
    elif operator == "-":
        return value1 - value2
    elif operator == "*":
        return value1 * value2
    return value1 / value2


# Alternative:
def basic_op(operator, value1, value2):
    return eval(f'{value1}{operator}{value2}')
